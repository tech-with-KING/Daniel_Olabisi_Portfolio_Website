    `RSA FACTORING CHALLENGE:
I took part in the rsa factoring challenge for prime numbers i tried with both
c and python with the setback with c being that codes were bulkier and more
complex but it also offered the perk of faster speed .While with python the
codes were shorter and a little bit more concise but i had to trade off the
speed 
learn a lot about the complexities of great algorithms
